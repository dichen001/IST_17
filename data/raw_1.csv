Instead, authorization is re-requested via an iframe using prompt=none and id_token_hint= properties. It would be good if this provided a way to override the re-authorization logic (e.g. don't assume it is via refresh token). I think the idea would be to be able to provide a renewal function, in which we either use http service to perform a refresh via refresh token, or some other logic that is more compliant with the authentication system we're using.    trigger for re-authentication needs to include cases when an authenticated call returns a 401 response, not just when a token is scheduled to expire. If re-authentication fails we need to surface this error to the consumer so they can redirect or something.    AuthHttp needs to handle queuing subsequent requests made through it while awaiting the result of the renewal function. The idea is that renewal should be an atomic operation.","Y,improve",It would be good to queue up requests (less important if there is any preemptive refresh mechanism) but that could be handled if needed within the refresh method which is returning an observable. It just needs to keep track if it already has any in-flight request (probably some rxjs operator can make that easy as well as things like retries).,"Y, no value","chenkie commented on Feb 26Thanks again for this @CaptainCodeman :) As mentioned in the issue, this is better suited to a separate module, which I'd love to collaborate on.

I will give you a feedback tomorrow, I'm busy today.$$$$I really like this feature, even though personally I wouldn't probably use it, I'm thinking this could be something people could be really interested in. As a podmin I would probably want to somehow restrict abuse of this feature, especially if I use an email service which costs money after X amount of emails (like I personally do, Mandrill in this case). Not sure how this could be restricted neatly..Btw, basing a big feature like this on master is risky since they can be very far away, especially the UI side is almost rewritten in develop (styling parts). If you can't base it on develop, prepare for lots of tweaking once the time comes since it must be merged in to develop.Connecting to the federation: Currently, this pull request only considers the local pod. What is the proper way to extend the code to properly talk to the other pods? I suspect, each pod should be responsible for notifying its local users. Then, the notification should be triggered when posts are created from outside. Where is the proper place to do this?You only need to hook into something that processes posts from the outside, the settings themselves don't need to be federated out. But I think better just hijack some part that doesn't care whether the message is from the outside or inside - I guess StatusMessage model might be one logical place.Translation in other languages: Who is responsible to provide i18n for new features? Currently, this pull request provides en, de and de_formal.Only ever include en in the code - the rest are done via WebTranslateIt.Btw, regarding pushing code to pull requests. To stop mail spam due to automated code review comments to project admins, please try to remember to run pronto locally as in our wiki, and before pushing fix any obvious issues so there is less email spam, thanks!","Y,core","Also, I've adopted the new boostrap-4 css classes.I think we're still on bootstrap3?Does it do any harm if I've included the de translation already? I.e. do I have to remove these translations from the pull request?Yes you should remove any non-en translations, sorry. Once the feature lands, you will be able to do them at WebTranslate.I've thought about that. But wouldn't I expect email delivery being triggered by something like a countroller?If there is email delivery from within the model layer, how would one prevent the system from sending emails when doing maintinance from a rake task or the rails console?TBH, I'm not sure where the notifications/emails are triggered. But unlikely from a controller, since you must consider most of the posts on a pod come from the outside, not via the web UI.But, now that you mention notifications (I think you did), it makes sense to do this in a way that it is not tied to sending emails, but tie it to notifications instead. So then user is able to choose whether to receive emails or not, or just to follow the notifications as regular notifications.For clarification, for example comments trigger notifications to other users, where appropriate. IF the user has the relevant checkbox set in their settings, the notification is delivered also by email. I think doing it the same way would reuse the most code and architecture design - also it would be clearer for the users. What do you think?",N,{},N,{},"Rej, not sure.",{},,

Or something similar.I feel putting stream content filtering under here might be the wrong place - maybe just restrict it to 1) no subscription and 2) receive notifications? And then have a checkbox also in the main email notifications settings with default true to govern whether this notification is also delivered via email.Filtering content for the stream should probably not be tied to this feature imho. It is something that is wanted in general, to be able to for example save a stream with certain filters.","Y,not fit.|Y, no value","Closing this pull requestEither way, both ideas are far beyond what this pull request has tried to do.As there are still a couple of unresolved issues (see checkboxes in the pull request description at the top of this page) and I don't have the time to address them properly at the moment, I'll close this pull request for now.",Merged.,{},,

It applies to various types of operators like JDBC, S3, HDFS. It should be possible to have any operator configured for synchronous and asynchronious processing.$$$$If every time new functionality is introduced, a completely new operator is also introduced, we will end up with dozens of operators that expose related functionality. Such approach complicates life for an application developer as it becomes confusing which operator out of those dozens to use or extend. IMO, there should be an attempt to reuse and extend existing functionality first and only in case there are technical reasons not to do so, a brand new operator should be introduced.The value of such abstract operator is limited as it does not allow to reuse existing wide range of input and output connectors and functional operators and requires reimplementation of every connector if async processing is necessary (please correct me if I am wrong).For every tuple it processes it creates at minimum 2 additional objects not counting input and output tuples. For high throughput operators, this will lead to extensive GC.While Apex was designed to adjust to the input rate and either propagate back pressure or elastically scale if configured, AbstractAsyncProcessor is configured with the fixed number of threads and if those threads are not capable of keeping up with the input rate, the queue of tuples to process will grow indefinitely, leading to out of memory errors and huge checkpoint snapshots with no way to recover out of this condition.","Y,others","What is the immediate need for this functionality? Are there other malhar operators that depend on the AbstractAsyncProcessor?Why is it necessary to introduce the new operator instead of extending the existing one that provides related functionality?Checkpointing is a joint functionality of the Apex platform and operators.

My idea was that a BiasLayer on 4D input should always have a 4D bias tensor with broadcastable singleton dimensions for all shared axes, instead of creating, say, a 2D tensor and adding the correct broadcastable dimensions in get_output_for(). It does the latter now to be compatible with existing biases, but this also means it's got to have the somewhat complex dimshuffle pattern generator.Okay for me as well. One might want to try continuing training from the standardization, but that only makes sense if the next layer doesn't start with a linear transformation anyway. That's probably not going to happen very often.Do you want to add the ScaleLayer and standardize() macro (the latter could reuse a lot of your current docstring)? The ScaleLayer should probably go into layers/special.py after the BiasLayer, about standardize() I'm not sure.","Y,not fit.","If you rebase onto the latest master (sorry about the merge conflict), layers/normalize.rst will magically appear for you to put the docs into.

If the kernel does not support this feature, we should not even try to set the ambient caps but simply print a warning and carry on.
